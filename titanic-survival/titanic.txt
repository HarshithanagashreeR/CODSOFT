Titanic Survival Prediction
 Objective
This project is a classic data science task to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The goal was to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build a machine learning model to achieve this.
Key Steps
*Data Cleaning: Handled missing values for 'Age' and 'Embarked' and dropped the 'Cabin' column.
*EDA: Visualized survival rates based on gender and passenger class.
*Preprocessing: Converted categorical features ('Sex', 'Embarked') into a numerical format.
*Model Building: Trained a RandomForestClassifier on the cleaned data.
Key Insights
* Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than male passengers.
* Passengers in 1st class had a much higher chance of survival compared to those in 3rd class.
Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of **[Model Accuracy: 82.12%]** on the test set.
